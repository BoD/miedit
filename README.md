Something that the French designed :-)

Using the emulator without the editor
-------------------------------------

You can use the Minitel emulator without the Minitel page editor for your own
project.

See [EMULATOR.md](EMULATOR.md) page.

Requirements
------------

Your browser must support:

- EcmaScript 6
- HTML5 canvas and web storage

At the time of this writing, Firefox supports running the pages without any web
server. Chrome won't allow you for security reasons.
